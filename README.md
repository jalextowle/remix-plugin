# Truffle Support Plugin for Remix
This plugin allows the Remix text editor to access the truffle service in a Remixd server. If the remixd server is run on the user's computer, this will allow Remix to run tests in the local filesystem. Paired with the shared folder functionality that Remixd already provides, Remix becomes fully integrated with Truffle on the same level that an editor running on the user's computer provides.
